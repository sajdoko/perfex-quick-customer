## Development Guidelines

### PHP Code Standards

- Follow PSR-12 coding standards
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use type hints where appropriate

Example:
```php
/**
 * Create a new customer from modal form
 *
 * @return void Outputs JSON response
 */
public function create()
{
    // Implementation
}
```

### JavaScript Code Standards

- Use ES5 syntax for maximum compatibility
- Use semicolons
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Wrap code in IIFE or jQuery ready function

Example:
```javascript
(function($) {
    'use strict';
    
    // Your code here
    
})(jQuery);
```

### CSS Code Standards

- Use meaningful class names
- Prefix custom classes to avoid conflicts
- Keep specificity low
- Add comments for sections

Example:
```css
/* Quick Customer Modal Styles */
.quick-customer-modal .form-group {
    margin-bottom: 15px;
}
```
